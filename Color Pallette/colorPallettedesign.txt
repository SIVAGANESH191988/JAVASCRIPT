Color Palette Design:
HTML:
1. Color Palette:
   - Creating several color boxes representing different colors.
   - Each color box is clickable hence onclick functionality should be implemented later.

2. Text Container:
   - Contains an input field where text should be entered.
   
JAVASCRIPT:
1. Functionality:
- Each color box:
     - Displays a specific color.
     - onclick event listner on a color box triggers a JavaScript function to change the text color.
     
   - Clicking on a color box changes the text color of the input field to the selected color.
   - The selected color is applied to the text immediately upon clicking.
   - The text color remains same until another color is selected.
