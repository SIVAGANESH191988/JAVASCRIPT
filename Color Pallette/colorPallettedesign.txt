Color Palette Design:
HTML:
1. Color Palette:
   - Creating several color boxes representing different colors.
   - Each color box is clickable hence onclick functionality should be implemented later.

2. Text Container:
   - Contains an input field where text should be entered.
   - whent text is given oninput functionality should be implemented later.
   
JAVASCRIPT:
1. Functionality:
- Each color box:
     - Displays a specific color.
     - onclick event listner on a color box triggers a JavaScript function to change the text color.
     
   changeTextRandomColor():

This function is triggered on any input in the text box.
It randomly changes the text color of the input field to match one of the colors from the color boxes.

 checkColorMatch(colour):

Triggered when any color box is clicked.
Checks if the text color of the input matches the clicked color box.
Gives an alert message depending on whether the match is successful or not and clears the text input if successful.
